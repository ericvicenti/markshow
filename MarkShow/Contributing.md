MarkShow needs help!

## Testing

Feel free to test the server and code to whatever extent you'd like. File lots of [issues](https://github.com/ericvicenti/markshow/issues). I can't say that I will personally be able address them all, but I'd like to get them all in the open so somebody in the community can jump in and help.

## Ideas

There are lots of things to work on. If you want to start on one of these items, make an new issue, assign yourself to it, fork the code, and we will all collaborate and help you on it.

* NPM Modularity

  Lets work on setting up markshow as an installable and extensible npm module.

* Indexed search (spotlight-quality doc search in the toolbar)
  
  Easiest way to implement this would probably be SQLite and and integration with a filesystem watcher like [watch](https://github.com/mikeal/watch)

* Unit Tests

* Theming

  Lets try to get markshow sites (including this one) off of the horrendously overused default Bootstrap theme

* More advanced templating system

* Support for a more advanced markdown dialect
