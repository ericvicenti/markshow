# Contributors

MarkShow needs great contributors!

There are lots of things to work on. If you want to start on one of these items, make an new issue, assign yourself to it, fork the code, and get hacking!

## MarkShow Spec

- For shortcomings and ambiguities in the spec, please file them as [issues](https://github.com/ericvicenti/markshow/issues)!

- If there is determination in the community, we can revise this example-spec to a more formal RFC

- Feel free to write improved docs or make pull requests

## MarkShow Showdown

- Help is greatly appreciated on cleaning this up, or integrating back with the origional [showdown](https://github.com/coreyti/showdown)!
  - Or, hell, rewrite MarkShow toHTML entirely!

- We need a test suite!
  * Port or integrate showdown tests
  * Test html escaping
  * Test identified headers

## MarkShow Server Features

* Indexed search (spotlight-quality doc search in the toolbar)
  
  Easiest way to implement this would probably be [SQLite Full Text Search](http://www.sqlite.org/fts3.html)

* Theming

  Lets try to get markshow sites such as this one off of the horrendously overused default Bootstrap theme

* Nicer templating system
